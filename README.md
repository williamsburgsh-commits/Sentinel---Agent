## 🌟 Overview

Sentinel is a next-generation monitoring system that brings autonomous, decentralized monitoring to the Solana blockchain. By leveraging CASH micropayments and the x402 protocol, Sentinel creates a sustainable ecosystem where users can deploy autonomous agents to monitor on-chain activity, with payments automatically processed for successful alerts and verifications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Autonomous Monitoring Agents** - Deploy self-executing monitors that watch for specific on-chain conditions
- **CASH Micropayments** - Pay-per-alert model using Solana's CASH token for efficient microtransactions
- **x402 Protocol** - Secure and transparent payment channels for monitoring services
- **Switchboard Oracles** - Reliable off-chain data feeds for complex monitoring conditions
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Advanced pattern recognition and anomaly detection using Anthropic Claude
- **CDP Embedded Wallets** - Seamless user onboarding with non-custodial wallet integration

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solana, Phantom CASH, x402 Protocol
- **Oracles**: Switchboard
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude
- **Authentication**: CDP Embedded Wallets
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel
